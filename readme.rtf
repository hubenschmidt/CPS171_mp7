In competitive diving, each diver makes dives of varying degrees of difficulty. Nine judges score each dive from 0 through 10 in steps of 0.5. The difficulty is a floating-point value between 1.0 and 3.0 that represents how complex the dive is to perform. The total score is obtained by discarding the lowest and highest of the judges' scores, adding the remaining scores, and then multiplying that total by the degree of difficulty. Write a program to score each of the dives, using the following input and output specifications, and determine the winner of the competition.
